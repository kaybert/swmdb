# StarWars Movie Database react project

My contribution to an interview assignment built in react and the [MUI](https://mui.com) library.

This project was initialized with creact-react-app.

The main components of this application will be found in [App](src/App.js) and [SortButton](src/SortButton.js).

I left some comments of my thought process in the components.
