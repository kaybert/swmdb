# StarWars Movie Database react project

My contribution to an interview assignment built in react and the [MUI]<https://mui.com/> library.
 
This project was initialized with creact-react-app

The main components of this app will be found in App.js and SortButton.js
I left some comments of my thought process inside the components.
